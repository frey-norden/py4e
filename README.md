# py4e *Python for Everybody"
PY4E is a python programming specialization on Coursera with 5 courses and a capstone project. The specialization is meant to focus more on informatics, rather than the traditional computer science computational focus of introductory courses. 

###Book
[See book here](https://www.py4e.com/book)

###Code
In this repo you will find the code I write and run as I go through the book and and video lectures. There will be many small code examples as I cover the topics and practice. As the courses progress, there will be more substance in the scripts or programs. 

###Intentions
I intend to organize the repo a bit so that there aren't just hundreds of scripts. I will determine how to group the codes once I've got them in here.
